## üéØ Confidence Threshold Explained

The confidence threshold determines how certain the AI must be before showing a prediction:

- **Low Threshold (0.0-0.3)**: Shows all predictions, even uncertain ones
- **Medium Threshold (0.3-0.7)**: Balanced approach (recommended)
- **High Threshold (0.7-1.0)**: Only shows very confident predictions

### When to Adjust Threshold:
- **Lower it** if you want to see all possible matches
- **Raise it** if you only want very confident predictions
- **Keep default (0.5)** for most use cases

## üìä Understanding Results

### Main Prediction
- **Traffic Sign Name**: The most likely traffic sign type
- **Confidence Score**: How certain the AI is (0-100%)
- **Confidence Level**: High/Medium/Low confidence indicator

### Top-5 Predictions
Shows the 5 most likely traffic sign types with their confidence scores:
- ü•á **1st Place**: Most likely prediction
- ü•à **2nd Place**: Second most likely
- ü•â **3rd Place**: Third most likely

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### Image Quality
- **Use Clear Images**: Sharp, well-focused photos
- **Good Lighting**: Avoid dark or overexposed images
- **Proper Angle**: Capture the sign from the front when possible
- **Avoid Obstructions**: Make sure the sign is not blocked by objects

### Image Content
- **Single Sign**: Focus on one traffic sign per image
- **Complete Sign**: Include the entire sign in the frame
- **Standard Signs**: Use common traffic sign types for best results
- **Avoid Distortions**: Minimize perspective distortion

### Technical Considerations
- **File Size**: Keep images under 10MB for faster processing
- **Format**: Use JPG or PNG for best compatibility
- **Resolution**: Higher resolution images generally work better
- **Aspect Ratio**: The system automatically resizes images to 48x48 pixels
